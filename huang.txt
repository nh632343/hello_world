glenack msilo Mama died when Candice was just eight months old, so she spent her childhood piecing together an image of him from other people's memories
hewas someone who really loved lifesays Candice He was someone who was so just in the moment If he heard a good song, no matter where he was, he was going to jump up and dance
it was at the age of nine that she found out some of these details herself, after noticing that a book called Into the Heart of Darkness - Confessions of Apartheid's Assassins - had a powerful effect on her mother's visitors
every time people would come over to the house she would ask me to go get this book, and people would cry and I'd hear screaming, Candice says I'd hear all these odd reactions, or at least what I considered odd at the time, and I just thought to myself, 'I know my dad is in this book, but I want to know, why is he inciting these reactions?'
one day she overheard the page that they turned to
so I told myself, 'OK, when I get the opportunity I'm going to turn to this page and just see'
about a week later, when her mother went shopping, Candice climbed on a chair and reached up high to take the book from the top of a cupboard in her mother's bedroom
she opened it to the page she had heard mentioned, and saw the horrific picture of a burnt body - her father - clutching the steering wheel of a car
in my mind, immediately I connected the fact that this was my father, this was how he died and he [Eugene de Kock] is the person who did it And because I knew what I did was wrong, that I wasn't allowed to open that book, I held it within myself
not saying anything to her mother, Candice says the resentment within her began to grow and become something else But her desire to find out more about her father only increased
ifound a picture album of his, says Candice I saw his pictures and his personality and quotes that he would just stick into this book He just seemed so enlightened, especially for someone living in the situation he was living in
but the pain and anger Candice was bottling up inside herself eventually began to affect her health
one night, at the age of 16, she was rushed to hospital with a pain in her chest so severe it was feared she was having a heart attack
the following day the doctor sat myself and my mum down and he said, 'You know you weren't having a heart attack, but in my over 20-something years of experience, I have never seen stress symptoms so severe in someone your age,' Candice says
he started pointing at all these different things that were manifesting in my body, all these ulcers, all these symptoms, and he said, 'I don't know how to tell you this, but your body's killing you, and if you don't change something I think you're really going to pass on'
candice acknowledged there was a problem I was not happy, healthy or even living to be honest, she says
inone, called the Nelspruit Amnesty hearing, de Kock talked in detail about the events of the day Candice's father was murdered On discovering the document, she felt a pit building in my stomach, she writes in a published memoir As she read she shuddered with anger, she says - she couldn't understand how a man could act in this way
candice was 23 at the time, and when her mother asked if it was something they should do she replied instantly
e family began talking to the prison guards, the prison counsellor and a priest, but at a certain point Candice turned round - and I just saw him, I just saw him sitting there, like he had appeared from thin air
two thngs shocked her
e looked like he'd been frozen in time From the pictures I'd seen as a child to who was sitting there was the exact replica of the same person, it was unreal, Candice says
but also, she had expected this 65-year-old man, the man known as Prime Evil, to have an aura - an evil aura And she was surprised to find that he didn't
as the priest introduced the family one by one, Eugene de Kock would lean forward and say: Pleasure to meet you
cndice's mother began by asking what had actually happened to her husband on 26 March 1992 - the day he died
eugene told them that he and his team had sent an infiltrator into her father's camp to identify the most radical and skilled activists - the most dangerous people within the Pan Africanist Congress - says Candice Her father and three other men were chosen
on that day, he was due to drive to Nelspruit, a city 350km east of Johannesburg (renamed Mbombela in 2014)
what he didn't know was that Eugene De Kock and his team had set up an ambush, says Candice
so as my dad was driving under the [Nelspruit] bridge, the team started firing at the minibus
when Eugene de Kock, from the bridge, realised that the car wasn't coming to a stop, he ran down the embankment and he emptied out his magazine cartridge on my father, and when he still saw signs of life in the vehicle, he doused them all in fuel and he set them alight
we tell ourselves that normal human beings are not capable of such atrocities, Candice says But at this moment, it seemed very clear to Candice that Eugene de Kock was a normal human being, albeit one who did some extraordinarily terrible things
it almost forces you to step into their shoes for a little bit and say, 'You know what, if I had been dealt this pair of cards, if I had been raised by a militant father in a militant family, went to police academy, lived in an environment that told me that this was the enemy and this is what's right, and then I went on to be celebrated by my friends, by my peer groups for being the best at what I do… I mean, would I have turned out any different?
during the meeting, all of Candice's family were given a chance to ask Eugene any questions they had
candice knew what she wanted to ask
i said, 'Eugene I want to say I forgive you, but before I do, I want to know one thing' And he said, 'Sure what's that?'
i said, 'Do you forgive yourself?'
he was noticeably taken aback for the first time in the whole encounter and he said, 'Every time a family comes here, that's one question I pray they never ask me'
he looked away and he dabbed the side of his eye, because a tear had run down… and he looked back and said, 'When you've done the things I've done, how do you forgive yourself?'
candice started crying, not for herself or her father, but - she says - because she realised that de Kock would never know peace
we were both two people that were broken, sitting in front of each other, and so it was a very transformative moment, she says
at the end of the meeting, Candice stood up first and walked over to Eugene de Kock and asked if she could hug him
he stumbled up to his feet and he held me in an embrace and he said, 'I'm so sorry for what I've done, and your father would have been so proud of the woman you've become'
she knew that he had been working with the National Prosecuting Authority to find people who had gone missing years ago or to help locate bodies, to bring the victims' families some solace
they had told me, 'It's very difficult to continue doing this work because there's so many places where he tells us that these bodies are buried that we just can't reach without him' So I thought if he was going to be more of a benefit to certain families outside of prison, then that to me felt more just than him rotting away in a prison cell, and having families out there mourning someone that they could never physically bury
for many of the victims of Eugene's atrocities, forgiveness will never be possible But for Candice, forgiveness has given her freedom from the trauma she felt as an innocent nine-year-old girl staring in disbelief at the horror of that picture
you can experience incredible trauma and it is not your fault, and a lot of people will say, 'Well why is it on me to forgive when I didn't do anything?' says Candice But I would say to that, every time you give that incident or that person power, you are inflicting more damage on yourself, so you are re-traumatising yourself, and in many ways you are giving that person continued power over your life
candice has written a book about her life entitled Forgiveness Redefined
a young man walks past, very drunk, and notices the nurse's shapely legs Despite his inebriation, he offers to drive the women to hospital This is the start of the romance between Margaret and Derek Romburgh
we always say that they met during an earthquake and from there worked up to a crescendo, says Nathan Romburgh, 42, their youngest child He describes his mother as a character She could talk herself into any job, and then straight back out again, he says
the marriage was not a happy one Derek continued to drink, and they had very little money Margaret dealt with it by creating a fantasy world, telling the children that they were too rich to need a mortgage, and that they were going to install a lift in their house The children never knew what to believe
she was a fantasist, says Nathan I think it's part of how you deal with a difficult life, you have stories in your mind - and we just grew to discount those
she was a bit of a compulsive liar, agrees Bernadette, Nathan's oldest sister We never knew if any of it was true - I'm not sure she even knew
e children - Bernadette, Shereen and Nathan - knew very little about their mother's past and never met her adoptive family She had been adopted as a baby by devout Orthodox Jews, who had died when she was a teenager The rest of the family disowned her when she married Derek, a non-Jew
despite this, Margaret had always clung proudly to her Jewish identity
we had a bit of an odd life, growing up, because my mother was Jewish and my father was not, says Nathan For Passover we would be fasting and not allowed to eat anything leavened, and in the middle of it my father would bring home hot-cross buns
nathan had a difficult relationship with his mother and when their parents divorced in 1991, he chose not to live with her, moving in with his paternal grandparents instead
here's no sugarcoating it - she was a terrible mother, he says
three years later, as Margaret was dying of breast cancer, she made an announcement: she had a sister Her children dismissed it as just another of her made-up stories
years passed, then, in 2008, Bernadette got breast cancer, too
genetic tests showed that Bernadette's cancer was the same type as her mother's, although the mutations did not sit on the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes - an aggressive form of inherited cancer that occurs more frequently in the Ashkenazi Jewish community than in the rest of the population
it scared us a lot, says Nathan We decided that we really ought to know a bit more about our exposure to things from my mother's genes
so, while Bernadette focused on getting through treatment, Nathan and his sister Shereen set out to find out more about their family history
for Nathan it was disappointing to discover this when it was already too late, especially since it turned out he had lived just down the road from his aunt Norma in London
mary had moved to the UK and married later in life Now, armed with her married name, Nathan searched UK records for Mary's death certificate, and also Norma's
that was when he made a shocking discovery: his aunt Norma and his mother shared a birthday
the secret Mary had taken to her grave was that she'd given birth to twins - but kept only one
ince the first arrival of early colonisers, mixed-race relationships had occurred in South Africa - Dutch settlers had families with local Khoisan and Xhosa women, as well as with women from Malaysia or St Helena, some of whom had been brought over as slaves
ut after the National Party came to power in 1948, laws were passed that made such relationships illegal
he Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act forbade marriage between Europeans and non-Europeans and became law on 8 July 1949 - a month before the twins were born
he Population Registration and Immorality Acts of 1950 went further, prohibiting sexual relationships between people of different races and requiring everyone to register as a member of three race classes: Black (African), White (European), Coloured Later, a fourth, Indian, was added
hese racial classifications were often decided on the basis of photographs or superficial observations, including the infamous pencil test in which a pencil was put in someone's hair - if they shook their head and the pencil fell out, they were classified as white, but if it stayed in, they were not
ut people of mixed descent could look very different, even within the same family
A Cape Coloured person could be anything from very pale with green eyes to someone who's quite dark, says Nathan
t's impossible to know how the turmoil of early apartheid influenced Mary, but it's likely that it had some bearing on what happened to her babies She kept the twin who would have been classified as Coloured, and gave away the twin who looked White
Se may have had no choice in the matter - perhaps the Jewish family that adopted Margaret rejected Norma because they didn't want a child who looked different from them Or perhaps they only wanted one child, not two
But Nathan believes Mary thought she was offering Margaret the chance of a better life
f you were a coloured woman and you had two babies, one of whom was white, I could see that it is entirely possible and actually quite probable that if you gave up your white baby you'd be doing it for altruistic reasons, he says
ssentially it seems like a bit of a Sophie's Choice scenario I could think of no other reason why you would give up one twin and not the other
nder apartheid, life became increasingly difficult for people of mixed descent, such as the Francis family
acial classifications governed all aspects of daily life - where people could live, what public transport they could use and what schools or hospitals they could use
s a consequence, apartheid often split families where parents or siblings were classified as different races
lan Francis remembers this well He was dark-skinned, with black curly hair, whereas his sister was fair-skinned with brown hair
t that time I wouldn't be able to walk down the road with my sister, I wouldn't be able to sit on the same park bench or go to the same cinema, go on the same bus - nothing, he says
or could they earn as much money as white people
o in the 1950s Alan's parents emigrated to the UK, and many members of the Francis family followed Including, in 1956, Mary Francis and seven-year-old Norma
ary got a job with London Transport, where she met her husband, an engineer Mother and daughter remained close and lived together for most of their lives

ut did Norma ever know she had a twin sister in South Africa?
t seems that in the last few years of her life Margaret tried repeatedly to contact members of her birth family, but nobody responded
nd yet some people knew about her existence
oy Francis, another cousin who emigrated to Canada in the 1970s, remembers visiting a family friend in Cape Town in 1985, who asked after Mary's other daughter Roy was completely taken aback by the question
hrough all the years, nobody in the Francis family clan ever spoke about another child in Mary's life, says Roy I felt that I would not open a can of worms so I decided not to discuss this with anyone
e remembered that strange conversation though, in 1992 or 1993, when his cousin Nora, who also lived in Canada, received a letter from a woman in Cape Town who was looking for her birth mother, Mary Francis She wrote that she had terminal breast cancer and was keen to make contact
nora was astonished to notice that this woman's date of birth was exactly the same as Norma's But when she asked her own mother [Mary's sister] about it, her mother dismissed the letter, saying it was from a crazy woman
norma, Mary's husband George and Mar
orma herself never quite knew the full story, according to a close family friend, Crispin Belcher, who looked after her when she had cancer During a hospice visit Norma confided in him that she had once picked up the phone in her mother's flat to hear a woman say, I think you're my aunt
orma passed the phone to her mother, who listened, then said, I don't want you to call any more, and put the phone down
hat was all Norma knew about it, says Crispin He is surprised that Mary reacted that way She was always a very jolly person, but thinking about what I know now, that may have been a bit of a façade, he says
lan Francis can't understand it either It was uncharacteristic because Aunt Mary was the kindest, nicest person, he says

athan began to feel sorry for his mother, when he discovered that her attempts to contact her family had been consistently rebuffed
ut he was excited about getting to know the Francises, and discovering his unexpected mixed-race heritage came as a pleasant surprise
t just added a little bit more depth to my origins, I was really quite proud of it, he says
e set his hopes on finding relatives on the other side of the family and decided to trace his biological grandfather, who had employed Mary Francis, and got her pregnant By this stage he knew he was called Dr Joshua
ora Francis, from the Canadian side of the family, remembered the doctor well, and she told Nathan that he was Jewish She used to see him in the canteen of the Groote Schuur hospital, where she worked as a nurse
e knew exactly who he was, she told Nathan
